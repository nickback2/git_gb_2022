# Репозиторий для тренировки

Делаем себе fork, вносим изменения и присылаем Pull request.

i haven't grasped with SSH-key.
I took .sh file from GB-homework page, file opened it in git bash, conneted with name of file, i selected name as on gitHub git_gb_2022.
I got the message "enter passphrase(empty for no passphrase)"-empty doesn't match

i decided to do homework via "git clone 'link of repository'"

my steps to work with fork's remote repositories:
1. Make new folder and open it in any IDE
2. Open terminal and fill in "git clone 'link of repository'"
3. Make new branch, checkout to this branch, make changes, save file, commit.
4. Make push used to "git push --set-upstream origin NewTestBranch"
5. Create pull request on GitHub
